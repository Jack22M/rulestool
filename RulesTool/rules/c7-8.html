        <p>Play is restarted with a sixteen if the ball goes over the baseline and was last tochued by an attacker. A sixteen cam be taken anywhere inline with where it went out from the basline to the top of the circle (15 metres from the basline). In the diagram below, the green/yellow line indicates the highest that a sixteen can be taken. The red shaded area shows the that it can be taken from the basline to the fifteen metres. <b><i>Note: A ball cannot be taken <u>anywhere</u> in the redshaded area. See examples below.</i></b></p>

        <div class="indent"><h1>Example of Restarting Play with a Sixteen</h1></div>
        <p>In the following diagram, the ball goes over the baseline at <b>A</b> and was last touched by an attacker so therefore a sixteen restarts play. The defenders can take the ball anywhere inline with A (where it went out) and 15 metres from the basline as shown by the arrow going from <b>A</b> to <b>B</b>. Usually, most defenders will take the ball at B (inline with the top of the circle) however in some scenarios it makes sense to take it somewhere inbetween A and B.</p>
