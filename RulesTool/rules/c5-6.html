        <ul>
            <li>The rules stipulate for the game length to be four fifteen-minute quarters.</li>
        </ul>
             <div class="rin">
                 <p>Many competitions and tournaments modify the lengths of games and it is always important to check regulations to verify the length of games.</p>
             </div>
             <li>The team that scores the most goals is the winner - if none or equal are score it is a tie.</li>
    <h2 class="indent">Chapter 6</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A (coin or in some competitions a stick) toss is taken before the start of the match to decide who starts with the ball and which direction the teams will attack.</li>
            <li>The winner of the toss can either choose to take the centre pass at the start of the first to quarters or choose the direction that they will attack.</li>
            <li>The loser of the toss will get the option that the winner did not take. For example, if the winner chooses to start with the ball, the winner chooses the direction they will run.</li>
            <li>At the start of the third quarter (or second half) the team taking that didn't take the centre pass at the start takes it and the direction of attack reverts.</li>
            <li>A centre pass is also taken after a goal is scored - the team the goal is scored against takes the pass</li>
            <li>Rule 6.5 includes information about a bully which is rarely seen in the game these days.</li>
