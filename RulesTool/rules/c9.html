        <p>In the video below, the Australian player is running in with the ball (under control) inside the circle, and then the Belgium (defending) player comes and runs into (body contact) the attacker who falls to the ground. The umpire originally makes no call and plays on however after a lengthy video referall, a penalty stroke is awarded for a body tackle in the circle. <i>Note: this is a quite a bad tackle and tackles like this do not occur often in international matches.</i></p>

        <p><i>Important Context: This is an U15 Girls Nationals Semif-final in the last five minutes and the score is 0-0.</i> In the following video, the NSW (defending) team are ready for the PC and Victoria are taking a long time to be ready and are warned by the umpire. After being warned for taking too long, Victoria still is not ready, so a free hit is awarded against them.</p>
